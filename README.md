igitalong is for making like easier with git on the IBM i.

The first utility will push source members to the IFS, create branches, commit, and push.  
It was written to allow use of git-integrated tools like FishEye and Crucible, while still letting 
us keep the rest of our existing release process.   

It could be used for more if you're adventurous, or scaled down to just pushing filesystem changes 
and adding to the the changeset if that's all you need.


If you're reading this then the code is still in the process of being cleaned up.  Which means it's a good time to request features, etc.

Please consider finding us on gitter or submitting an issue to let us know how we can help i "gitalong" for you!
